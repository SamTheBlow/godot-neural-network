# godot-neural-network

A basic neural network made in Godot 4.2

One hundred AIs are tasked to throw a ball into a hoop (like in basketball). Only the best of the best make it to the next round. How good will the AI get?

After about 100 generations, I found that the AI is able to score 5 goals in under a minute. It's not doing it in the way you'd expect, though...

Features:
- Shows you the current AI's brain in the corner of the screen
- Shows all 100 AIs playing at the same time
- You can save and load neural networks
- You can play the minigame yourself (requires enabling it in the code)


The code is not very good (it dates from december 2022), but if you for some reason want to contribute, contributions are welcome!
